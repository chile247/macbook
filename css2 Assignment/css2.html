<b>My name is Lauretta Chile</b>. I have always been interested in finding creative and innovative ways to make life easier. This made me naturally find technology fascinating. I discovered that i could use a variety of tools to solve a life long issue and i think that is pretty amazing. <i>I have discovered that there is really no human generated problem that can not be solved , we have not just discovered the right technological tools to merge together to get the result we want.</i>

I have been able to learn alot during the course of my learning at <i>stutern</i> . i have learnt about html as a markup language and not a programming language. i have come to understand that it is the skeletal structure of every web page. <i>Css</i> on the other hand is cascading style sheets , it gives beauty to the web page. <b>it helps you position elements and makes the general outlook of a page user friendly in terms of how it appeals physically to the human senses.</b> This is one of the many reasons why css is important.

    <p class="section-3">
There are three very important properties in css and that's <b>padding, margin and border </b>
Padding is the inner space between the content and the border box, we have padding left, right, top and bottom.
Border is the perimeter of the box. <i>it could be invisible .</i>we have different border styles, it could be solid, dotted e.t.c. While margin is the outer space or lack of space surrounding the box. we have margin left, right, top and bottom.
