    <h4>About the Food</h4>
    <p>Yamarita is plain boiled yam that is coated in egg, flour, ginger, garlic, and salt. Donâ€™t forget the frying part.
This is one of the most popular Hausa food. I see it in a different restaurant every day, it is nearly as popular as suya.
This recipe is detailed and one of the most comprehensive.Yamarita is just easy and delicious. You can make this in just about 45 minutes. I decided to serve with tomato stew. You can also serve with egg sauce, ketchup or even Monica sauce.</p>
